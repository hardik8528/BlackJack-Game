Here Is BlackJack Game Which I Have Made IF You Don't Know About It Follow Given Step\
\
==>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.\
==>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.\
==>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.\
==>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.\
==>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 15 or higher.\
